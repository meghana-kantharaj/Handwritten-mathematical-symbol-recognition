# Handwritten-mathematical-symbol-recognition
With the advancement of technology., computers become more human like. It naturally makes sense for them to be able to read human writing. This project was developed to experiment with a computerâ€™s ability to read human handwriting i.e. inconsistent styles and patterns with same meaning. This project aligns with computer vision, pattern recognition and artificial intelligence and employs machine learning and image processing techniques.
